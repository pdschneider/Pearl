# 🏗️ Pearl Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of Pearl's codebase and design decisions. It is intended for developers who want to understand how the application is structured.

## Overview

Pearl is a fully local, privacy-focused AI chat desktop application built with Python. It features a graphical user interface using **Custom Tkinter** with certain elements built with **PySide6**, integrates with local LLMs via Ollama, supports multiple text-to-speech engines, and file uploads.

The application is designed to be:
- **Fully offline-first** — no user data leaves the local machine by default after setup
- **Cross-platform** — Windows and Linux (with Android support considered for the future)
- **Easy to build and distribute** — using Nuitka (Linux) and PyInstaller + Inno Setup (Windows)
- **Modular** — to allow future extensibility (new models, TTS backends, prompt styles, etc.)

## Core Components

### 1. GUI Layer (Custom Tkinter + PySide6)
- Main window and primary interface
- Chat view, sidebar (chat history), input area
- Settings page with multiple sub-pages, plus onboarding page
- Message boxes and file selection boxes built with PySide6

### 2. Backend / Core Logic
- Chat management and conversation history
- Prompt switching and context handling
- File attachment logic
- Setup scripts for onboarding (installs for Ollama, Docker + Kokoro)

### 3. AI Integration
- Ollama client wrapper + kokoro TTS wrapper
- Model discovery, download, and metadata handling
- Response streaming and processing

### 4. TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Multiple TTS backends (pyttsx3 + Kokoro)
- Future STT support (Vosk, etc.)

### 5. Data & Persistence
- `defaults/` directory for configuration and assets
- Chat history storage
- User preferences and personalization data

```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**: GUI code is kept separate from core logic where possible.
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally. No telemetry or cloud services are used by default.
- **Modularity**: TTS, LLM backend, and storage are designed to support multiple implementations.
- **Why PySide6**: Chosen for better styling, performance, and modern Qt features compared to the current Custom Tkinter implementation.
- **Build Strategy**: One-file executables for easy distribution while maintaining reasonable binary size.

## Data Flow (Simplified)

1. User types message or uploads file
2. Prompt builder combines message + conversation history + file contents + prompt
3. Request sent to Ollama backend
4. Response is processed, displayed, and optionally spoken via TTS
5. Conversation is saved to local storage (optional)

## Extensibility Points

- Adding new LLM backends (beyond Ollama)
- Adding new TTS/STT engines
- Creating additional prompt templates or "roles"
- Remembering elements of past chats
- Supporting new file types for attachments

## Future Considerations

- Improved testing
- Performance optimizations for large context windows
